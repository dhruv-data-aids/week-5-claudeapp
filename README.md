## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Database | Supabase (custom auth — no Supabase Auth) |
| AI | Azure OpenAI |
| PDF parsing | pdfjs-dist |
| DOCX parsing | mammoth |

---

## Key Decisions

- **Custom auth** — login and signup use a `users` table with bcrypt-hashed passwords. Supabase Auth is not used.
- **Azure calls are server-only** — the `/api/chat` route proxies all AI requests. The Azure endpoint is never exposed to the browser.
- **File parsing is client-side** — PDFs and DOCX files are parsed to plain text in the browser before being sent to the API.
